# Owned Entity Types
In EF Core, `owned entity types` are a feature that allows you to define and work with entities that are conceptually owned by another entity. Owned entity types are used to represent complex value objects that are stored as part of the owning entity's table in the database.
```csharp
[Owned]
public class StreetAddress
{
    public string Street { get; set; }
    public string City { get; set; }
}

public class Order
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public StreetAddress ShippingAddress { get; set; }
}

public void Configure(EntityTypeBuilder<Order> builder)
{
    builder.OwnsOne(order => order.ShippingAddress);
}
```

1. The properties of the owned entity type are stored within the table of the owning entity in the database. There is no separate table for the owned entity type.
2. An owned entity type represents an ownership relationship between an owning entity and the owned entity. The owned entity is a part of the owning entity and does not have its own identity or lifecycle. It cannot exist independently of the owning entity.
