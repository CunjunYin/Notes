# One to One
A one-to-one relationship is made up from:
1. One or more primary or alternate key properties on the principal entity.
2. One or more foreign key properties on the dependent entity.
3. Optionally, a reference navigation on the principal entity referencing the dependent entity.
4. Optionally, a reference navigation on the dependent entity referencing the principal entity.

## Required one-to-one
```csharp
// Principal (parent)
public class Author
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public Profile Profile { get; set; }// Reference navigation to dependent
}
// Dependent (child)
public class Profile {
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
    public int AuthorId { get; set; }// Required foreign key property
    public Author Author { get; set; }// Required reference navigation to principal
}
```
```csharp
public void Configure(EntityTypeBuilder<Author> builder)
{
    builder.HasOne(author => author.Profile)
        .WithOne(profile => profile.Author)
        .HasForeignKey<Profile>(profile => profile.AuthorId);
}

public void Configure(EntityTypeBuilder<Profile> builder)
{
    builder.HasOne(profile => profile.Author)
        .WithOne(author => author.Profile)
        .HasForeignKey<Profile>(profile => profile.AuthorId);
}
```

# One to Many
HasMany and WithOne methods are defined in EF Fluent API to configure one-to-many relationship. A one-to-many relationship is made up from:
1. One or more primary or alternate key properties on the principal entity; that is the "one" end of the relationship.
2. One or more foreign key properties on the dependent entity; that is the "many" end of the relationship.
3. Optionally, a collection navigation on the principal entity referencing the dependent entities.
4. Optionally, a reference navigation on the dependent entity referencing the principal entity.

An example of configuring a one-to-many relationship between two entities, Author and Book, using the Fluent API:
```csharp
// Principal (parent)
public class Author
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public ICollection<Book> Books { get; set; }
}

// Dependent (child)
public class Book
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string BookName { get; set; }
    public Author Author { get; set; }
}
```

There are two ways to config one to many relationship
```csharp
// Methods 1
public void Configure(EntityTypeBuilder<Author> builder)
    {
        builder.HasMany(author => author.Books)
           .WithOne(book => book.Author)
           .HasForeignKey(book => book.AuthorID);
    }

// Methods 2
public void Configure(EntityTypeBuilder<Book> builder)
{
    builder.HasOne(book => book.Author)
        .WithMany(author => author.Books)
        .HasForeignKey(book => book.AuthorID);
}
```

# Many to Many
To configure a many-to-many relationship using the Fluent API, a join entity (also called an intermediary or link entity) is required to represents the relationship of itself. This join entity typically contains foreign keys to both of the related entities.

In the example below `UsingEntity` method is used to specify the join entity type.
```csharp
// Implicit configuration
public void Configure(EntityTypeBuilder<Book> builder)
{
    builder.HasMany(user => user.users)
        .WithMany(book => book.books);
}

// Explicit configuration
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<Book>()
        // Collection property in the 'Book' entity
        .HasMany(b => b.Authors)
        // Collection property in the 'Author' entity
        .WithMany(a => a.Books)
        // Specify the join entity type (can be an existing entity or anonymous type)                 
        .UsingEntity<Dictionary<string, object>>(    
            "BookAuthor", // Name of the join table
            j => j.HasOne<Author>().WithMany(), // property in the join entity to 'Author'
            j => j.HasOne<Book>().WithMany()  // property in the join entity to 'Book'
        );
}
```
