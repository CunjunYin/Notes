# Cascade Delete
In EF Core, cascade delete is a feature that allows you to configure the deletion behavior of related entities when the principal entity is deleted. When cascade delete is enabled, deleting a principal entity will automatically delete the related dependent entities.

To configure cascade delete with Fluent API
```csharp
public void Configure(EntityTypeBuilder<PrincipalEntity> builder)
{
    builder.HasMany(p => p.DependentEntities)
        .WithOne(d => d.PrincipalEntity)
        .OnDelete(DeleteBehavior.Cascade);
}
```

> Note: cascade delete can have significant consequences on the data integrity, use it with caution
