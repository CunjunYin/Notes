## EF Core Database First
In this methodology, models are reverse-engineered from an existing database, resulting in the generation of model files and a context file that encompass the definition and mapping information of the models. 

dotnet ef dbcontext scaffold [CONNECTION_STRING] [PROVIDER] [OPTIONS]

Sample cli below
> dotnet ef dbcontext scaffold "Server=SERVER;Database=DATABASE;Trusted_Connection=True;" Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer -o Models -c "DBContext"

| Option              |      Description             |
|---------------------|:-----------------------------|
| -o or --output-dir  | The directory where the class files will be generated. By default class files will be generated in the project directory. |
| -c or --context     | The Database Contect file name. By default it will be the database name.        |
| -d or --data-annotations | Use Data Annotations for configuration. By default the resulting model is configured using the Fluent API. |
| -h or --help        | Show help information |

If you get errors message:
```
Could not execute because the specified command or file was not found. Possible reasons for this include:
* You misspelled a built-in dotnet command.
* You intended to execute a .NET Core program, but dotnet-ef does not exist.
* You intended to run a global tool, but a dotnet-prefixed executable with this name could not be found on the PATH.
```
Then dotnet-ef not installed. Insall with following CMD or go to [dotnet-ef](https://www.nuget.org/packages/dotnet-ef)
> dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
