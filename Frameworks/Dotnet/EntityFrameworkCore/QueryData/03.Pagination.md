# Pagination
## Offset pagination
1. Data inconsistency during concurrent modifications: Offset pagination relies on a fixed order of the dataset. If new data is added or existing data is modified or deleted during pagination, the consistency of the paginated results can be affected. This issue is particularly relevant in scenarios with concurrent modifications, where it's possible to skip or duplicate records when paginating.
2. Performance impact with large offsets: As the offset value increases, the database query needs to skip a larger number of rows before returning the desired results. This can lead to performance issues, especially when working with very large datasets, as the database has to perform expensive operations to skip the offset number of rows.
```c#
var position = 20;
var nextPage = context.Posts
    .OrderBy(b => b.PostId)
    .Skip(position)
    .Take(10)
    .ToList();
```

## Keyset pagination
```c#
var lastId = 55;
var nextPage = context.Posts
    .OrderBy(b => b.PostId)
    .Where(b => b.PostId > lastId) // use a WHERE clause to skip rows, instead of an offset
    .Take(10)
    .ToList();
```

## Multiple pagination keys
```c#
var lastDate = new DateTime(2020, 1, 1);
var lastId = 55;
var nextPage = context.Posts
    .OrderBy(b => b.Date)
    .ThenBy(b => b.PostId)
    .Where(b => b.Date > lastDate || (b.Date == lastDate && b.PostId > lastId))
    .Take(10)
    .ToList();
```
