# Fluent API One to many relationship config
HasMany and WithOne methods are defined in EF Fluent API to configure one-to-many relationship

An example of configuring a one-to-many relationship between two entities, Author and Book, using the Fluent API:
```csharp
public class Author
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }

    public ICollection<Book> Books { get; set; }
}

public class Book
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Title { get; set; }

    public int AuthorId { get; set; }
    public Author Author { get; set; }
}
```

There are two ways to config one to many relationship
```csharp
// Methods 1
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<Author>()
        .HasMany(a => a.Books)
        .WithOne(b => b.Author)
        .HasForeignKey(b => b.AuthorId);
}

// Methods 2
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<Book>()
        .HasOne(b => b.Author)
        .WithMany(a => a.Books)
        .HasForeignKey(b => b.AuthorId);
}
```

## EF Core one-to-many relationship data acquisition
### Eager Loading
Eager loading retrieve the related entities along with the main entity in a single database query. Eager loading is achieved using the `Include()` method.
```csharp
// Retrieve an author with all their books
using (var context = new DbContext())
{
    var author = context.Authors
        .Include(a => a.Books) // Eagerly load the related books
        .FirstOrDefault(a => a.Id == authorId);
    
    var books = author.Books; // Access the loaded books
}
```

### Explicit Loading
Explicit loading manually load the related entities when needed. Explicit Loading achieved using `Collection` or `Reference` methods with `Load()` method.

1. Reference Methods: used to configure and work with a reference navigation property, which represents a `one-to-one` or `many-to-one` relationship between entities. It is typically used when there is a single related entity associated with the source entity.
```csharp
// Retrieve an author and explicitly load their books
using (var context = new YourDbContext())
{
    var author = context.Authors.Find(authorId);
    context.Entry(author).Collection(a => a.Books).Load(); // Explicitly load the books
    var books = author.Books; // Access the loaded books
}
```

2. Collection Method: used to configure and work with a collection navigation property, which represents a `one-to-many` or `many-to-many` relationship between entities. It is typically used when there are multiple related entities associated with the source entity.
```csharp
// Retrieve a book and explicitly load its author
using (var context = new YourDbContext())
{
    var book = context.Books.Find(bookId);
    context.Entry(book).Reference(b => b.Author).Load(); // Explicitly load the author
    var author = book.Author; // Access the loaded author
}
```

### Lazy Loading
Lazy loading is delaying the loading of related data, until you specifically request for it. In a one-to-many relationship, when accessing the parent entity's properties, the related child entities will be loaded automatically.
```csharp
// Retrieve an author and Lazy load their books
using (var context = new YourDbContext())
{
    var author = context.Authors.Find(authorId);

    /*
    * When accessing the Books property, EF Core will automatically
    * load the corresponding books from the database. (seperate SQL query)
    */
    var books = author.Books;
}
```
