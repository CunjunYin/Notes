# Snapshot
`Snapshot` refers to the state of an entity as it is being tracked by the EF change tracker. The change tracker keeps track of the original and current values of the properties of an entity to facilitate change tracking and database updates.

When an entity is retrieved from the database or created as a new instance, EF captures the initial state of its properties. This initial state is referred to as the "snapshot" or "original values". It represents the values of the entity's properties as they were at the time of retrieval or creation.

As you modify the properties of the entity, EF updates the current values and keeps the original values in the snapshot. This allows EF to detect changes made to the entity and generate appropriate SQL statements when saving changes to the database.

## Instance State
The EF change tracker keeps track of entities and their states to determine how they should be persisted or updated in the database. The entity state can change based on various operations performed on the entity, such as retrieval, addition, modification, or deletion.

EF provides several entity states that an entity can have. Here are the common entity states in EF:

1. Unchanged: The entity is being tracked by the change tracker, and its state has not changed since it was attached to the context or since the last call to `SaveChanges`. This means that no changes have been made to the entity's properties.

2. Added: The entity is newly created and has been added to the context, but it does not yet exist in the database. EF will insert this entity into the database when `SaveChanges` is called.

3. Modified: The entity has been modified by changing one or more of its properties. EF will generate an update statement for this entity when `SaveChanges` is called to persist the changes to the database.

4. Deleted: The entity has been marked for deletion. EF will generate a delete statement for this entity when `SaveChanges` is called to remove it from the database.

5. Detached: The entity is no longer being tracked by the change tracker. This can occur when an entity is explicitly detached from the context or when the context is disposed. Detached entities are not monitored or persisted by EF.

The entity state can be accessed and modified using the EF change tracker. Here's an example of how to check and modify the state of an entity in EF:

```csharp
var dbContext = new YourDbContext();
var entity = dbContext.Entities.Find(id);

var entry = dbContext.Entry(entity);
var currentState = entry.State;

// Modifying the state
entry.State = EntityState.Modified;
```
