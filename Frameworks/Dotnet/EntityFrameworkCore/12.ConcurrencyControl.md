Concurrency control in Entity Framework (EF) refers to the mechanisms and techniques used to handle situations where multiple users or processes are accessing and modifying the same data simultaneously. EF provides various strategies to address concurrency control, ensuring data consistency and handling conflicts that may arise when concurrent modifications occur.

There are two primary approaches to concurrency control in EF:

1. Optimistic Concurrency Control: In this approach, conflicts are detected at the time of saving changes to the database. EF compares the current state of the entity with the original state (snapshot) captured when the entity was retrieved or modified. If any conflicts are detected, an exception is thrown, and the application can handle the conflict accordingly.

   Optimistic concurrency control in EF can be implemented using one or more of the following techniques:
   - Timestamp/RowVersion: A special property in the entity that gets automatically updated by the database when a row is modified. EF uses this property to detect conflicts.
   - Concurrency Token: A property in the entity that is explicitly marked as a concurrency token. EF compares the current value of the token with the original value to detect conflicts.
   - Custom Comparisons: Custom logic can be implemented to compare specific properties or perform more complex conflict detection.

2. Pessimistic Concurrency Control: In this approach, locks are acquired on the data to prevent other users or processes from modifying it until the lock is released. EF doesn't provide built-in support for pessimistic concurrency control, but you can use database-specific features such as transaction isolation levels or explicit locking statements to implement this approach.

To enable optimistic concurrency control in EF, you can configure it in your entity model using data annotations or the Fluent API. Here's an example using data annotations:

```csharp
public class Product
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }

    [Timestamp]
    public byte[] RowVersion { get; set; }
}
```

In the code above, the `RowVersion` property is marked with the `[Timestamp]` attribute, indicating that it should be used for concurrency control. EF will automatically compare the current `RowVersion` value with the original value during updates to detect conflicts.

Handling concurrency conflicts typically involves catching and handling exceptions that are thrown when conflicts occur during the save operation. You can catch the `DbUpdateConcurrencyException` and inspect its properties to determine the conflicting entities and properties.

It's important to design your application's concurrency control strategy based on the specific requirements of your application and the database system you are using. Understanding the available concurrency control mechanisms in EF and choosing the appropriate approach ensures data consistency and resolves conflicts effectively in concurrent environments.
