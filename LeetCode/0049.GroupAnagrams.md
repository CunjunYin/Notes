Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

### Example 1:
```
Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: strs = [""]
Output: [[""]]
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: strs = ["a"]
Output: [["a"]]
```

```python
def groupAnagrams(strs: []) -> [[str]]:

    d = {}
    for s in strs:      
        h = 0
        for c in s:
            h = h + ord(c)%101
        if h in d:
            d[h].append(s)
        else:
            d[h] = [s]
    return d.values()
```
