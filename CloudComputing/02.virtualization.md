# Virtualization

Virtualization is one of the foundation technology for cloud computing. It is a technology that enable Softwares and Operating Systems to run on top of the virtualization layer in many(or any) environment. Generally speaking virtualization is:
* A machine thatâ€™s implemented in software, rather than hardware
* A self-contained environment that acts like a computer
* An abstract specification for a computing device (instruction set, etc.)

In Virtualization  there are two important terminology `Host` and `Guest`. Host is the the underlying layer that provides `resources/APIs` to allow user to operate, and Guest is the virtualized `resources/APIs` on top of virtualization software and virtualization software is on top of Host, so Guest can share host resources/APIs.

## What is the need of virtualization

In the practical world, a service running on a server generally will not utilize all the resources allocated to it, a waste of resources. One possible solution is to run multiple services on the server to utilise its capability fully. But, often it's more reliable to run individual tasks on individual servers due to running environment requirement. So with virtualization, raw computing resources like CPU, RAM, disk, network and other can be virtulized into isolated environment. 

## Types of virtualisation

In computer system, system are divided into multiple layers in bottom-up order. Generally speaking there are six layers,

**Table from bottom to top**
| Layer               |  Description |
| :------------------ | :----------- |
| 1. Information      | Data representation(0\|1) |
| 2. Hardware         | Raw computing resources |
| 3. Programming      | Lower level programs and instructions to controll hardware  |
| 4. Operating System | A big software to manage Programs and instructions(may provide UI) |
| 5. Application      | Software that running on top of OS |
| 6. Communication    | Communication with other systems |

As we can see this is like Layered architecture, each layer only has a specific role and responsibility within the system and each layer only needs to understand the underlying interface. So this provides opportunities for virtualisation to provide another program at the lower layer with interfaces that are consistent with the operating environment it was originally expected. Like VMware software, provides interfaces for other OS to run on top of **layer 4** `Operating System`. Therefore different virtualization concepts can be appied at at different layer.

There are three most common virtualization, the common distinction between them are:
* (language-based) virtual machines
  * Instruction set usually does not resemble any existing architecture
  * Java VM, .Net CLR, many others
* Virtual Machine Monitors (VMM) or Hypervisor
  * instruction set fully or partially taken from a real architecture


### 1. Hardware Level virtualisation (Hypervisor)
This is what AWS and Azure cloud providers use to provide computing instances in the cloud. As Hardware Level virtualisation(hypervisor) runs directly after firmware startup(usually OS in standard PC) - sometimes bootloader will run after firmware. It provides an abstraction layer that is the same/similar to the physical hardware instruction interface for guest operating systems, so each guest has its own virtua CPU, RAM, disk etc. Obviously, with only a hypervisor on top of the host, the performance is better than the other two types of virtualization.

### OS Level virtualisation (Virtual Machine Monitors)

OS level virtualization means the virtualization software run on top of operating systems like Windows, Linux or macOS. This virtualization layer provides an interface between the host OS `kernel` and gust software (OS), where each software is isolated. From the user's point of view, each host(is running OS) is just like a real computer, with its own file system, network, and functionalities. Due to the virtualization provided by the OS kernel, it is less flexible than `Hardware Level` but the performance is very close to Hardware Level virtualisation.

### Language Level virtualisation (Language-based)

This type of virtualisation is mainly used in programming languages like Java Virtual Machine(JVM) and .Net. The difference is it does not resemble existing architecture, it creates a virtual architecture to allow its own program to run in any given environment. For example, Java code got compiled into intermediate code, then the virtualizer translated it into machine language compatible with the host OS.

## How does it work

### Binary Translation

## Properties of Virtual Machines
* Partitioning
  * Run multiple operating systems on one physical machine.
  * Divide system resources between virtual machines.
* Isolation
  * Provide fault and security isolation at the hardware level.
  * Preserve performance with advanced resource controls.
* Encapsulation
  * Save the entire state of a virtual machine to files.
  * Move and copy virtual machines as easily as moving and copying files.
* Hardware Independence
  * Provision or migrate any virtual machine to any physical server.
