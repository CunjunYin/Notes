# OpenID Connect
OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an extenstion to OAuth2.0 protocol. It provides a standard way for user authentication and identity information to be exchanged securely between parties, such as a client application, an identity provider (IDP), and a resource server.

OpenID Connect allows a client application to verify the identity of a user by requesting authentication from a trusted IDP. The IDP authenticates the user and returns an ID token, which contains information about the user's identity, such as their name, email address, and other profile information. The client application can then use this information to provide personalized services and experiences for the user.

In addition to providing user authentication, OpenID Connect also supports single sign-on (SSO) and federation, allowing users to use their existing identity from one site or service to access multiple sites or services.

OpenID Connect is widely used for identity and access management in web and mobile applications, and is supported by many major identity providers, such as Google, Microsoft, and Okta. It is also used by organizations to provide secure and seamless access to enterprise resources and services.
