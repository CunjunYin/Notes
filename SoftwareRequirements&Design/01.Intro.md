# 1.1 Software Engineering
Software Engineering is technically two words - Software and Engineering, 
### 1.1.1 What is Software
> 1. `Instructions` (computer programs) that when executed provide desired features, function, and performance
> 2. `Data structures` that enable the programs to adequately manipulate information
> 3. `Documentation` that describes the operation and use of the programs.
   
`In simple words software is a set of instructions and data assets that exectue within a computer of any size.`

Software takes on a dual role. It is a `product`, and the vehicle for `delivering a product`.
### 1.1.2 What is Engineering
Engineering applies systematic, scientific and well-defined process to produce a good product.
### Therefore Software Engineering Definition is 
> 1. Systematic application of `scientific` and `technological knowledge`, `methods`, and `experience` to the design, implementation, testing, and documentation of software - [ISO standard]
> 
> 2. Application of a `systematic`, `disciplined`, `quantifiable` approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software; that is, the application of engineering to software - ISO/IEC TR 
# 1.2 Software Methodologies
> 1. a system of practices, techniques, procedures, and rules used by those who work in a discipline
> 
> 2. specification of the process to follow together with the work products to be used and generated, plus the consideration of the people and tools involved, during an information-based domain development effort
# 1.3 Software Processes
> A software process is a set of `interrelated activities` and tasks that `transform input work products` into `output work products`.
> 
> Activities are how the people spend their days. e.g. planning, programming, testing, meeting.
> 
> A process is how activities fit together time, often with `pre & post-conditions` for the activities.

# 1.4 Requirements Engineering
### 1.4.1 software requirement
> 1. software capability needed by a user to solve a problem or to achieve an objective
> 
>2. software capability that must be met or possessed by a system or system component to satisfy a contract, standard, specification, or other formally imposed document

### 1.4.2 software requirements analysis 3.3848
> 1. process of studying user needs to arrive at a definition of system, hardware, or software requirements

### software requirements engineering
> 1. science and discipline concerned with analyzing and documenting software requirements
> 
> 2. software requirements elicitation, analysis, specification, verification, and management cf. requirements engineering
