# Requirements Engineering
Requirements Engineering is an activity that includes requirements `elicitation` and `analysis`.
* Requirements Elicitation is an activity during which project participants define the purpose of the system.
* Requirements Analysis is an activity during which developers ensure that the system requirements are correct, complete, consistent and unambiguous

Requirements Example
```
Write a program thatwill read in a list of 100 positive integers, sort them into ascending order, display the sorted list and display the average of those values
```

## Why is Requirements Engineering Difficult?
* Real customers are not sure what they want
* May have many different stakeholders with different needs and priorities
* Real developers are not sure how to build it

## Requirements Engineering 4 Major Activities
1. Elicitation - discover the requirements
2. Analysis - ensure the requirements are correct, complete, consistent and unambiguous
3. Specification - document the requirements
4. Validation - ensure that the system addresses the clientâ€™s needs

## Project Requirements
* `Business Requirements` describe in business terms what must be delivered or accomplished to provide value.
  * Example: A maximum development cost requirement (a Process requirement) may be imposed to help achieve
* `Product Requirements` describe the system or product which is one of several possible ways to accomplish the business requirements
  * Example: A maximum sales price requirement
* `Process Requirements` describe the processes the developing organization must follow and the constraints that they must obey. 
  * Example: Requirements to follow particular development styles (e.g., OO), style-guides, or a review/inspection process
