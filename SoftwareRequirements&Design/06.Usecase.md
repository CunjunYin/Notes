# Conceptual Modelling

# Use cases
use case is similar to a user story, because it also describes one specific interaction between the user and the software. It  describe a complete interaction
between the software and users (and possibly other systems).

### Use case example - ExecuteTrip
1. The driver starts her car and logs into the onboard route
assistant
2. Upon successful login, the Driver specifies the planning service
and the name of the trip to be executed
3. The onboard route assistant obtains the list of destinations,
directions, segments and crossings from the planning service
4. Given the current position, the route assistant provides the driver
with the next set of directions
5. The Driver arrives at the destination and shuts down the route
assistant

##  Use Case Text Description
| Use Case Section | Description| 
| ------------- |:-------------|
| Name | An appropriate name for the use case – a short active verb phrase e.g. RegisterForCourses | 
| Goal | A brief description of the use case’s role and purpose, that is its goal      |  
| Flow of Events | A textual description (understandable to the customer) of what the system does with regard to the use case     |
| Special Requirements | Collects all requirements on the use case, e.g. non-functional reqs, that are not considered in the use-case model, but that need to be taken care of during design or implementation.      |
| Preconditions | A textual description that defines any constraints on the system at the time
the use case may start. |  
| Post conditions | A textual description that defines any constraints on the system at the time the use case will terminate.|
## Basic and Alternate Flow of Events
Basic flow of events describes what "normally" happens when the use case is performed. 

Alternate flows of events covers behavior of an optional or exceptional character relative to normal behavior, and also variations of the normal behavior.

### For example - RegisterForCourses
#### Basic Flow of Events
1. Logon This use case starts when a Student accesses the University Web site.
The system asks for, and the Student enters, the student ID and password.
2. Select 'Create a Schedule‘ The system displays the functions available to the student. The student selects "Create a Schedule.“
3. Obtain Course Information The system retrieves a list of available course offerings from the Course Catalog System and displays the list to the Student.
4. Select Courses The Student selects four primary course offerings and two alternate course offerings from the list of available course offerings.
5. Submit Schedule The student indicates that the schedule is complete. For each selected course offering on the schedule, the system verifies that the Student has the necessary prerequisites.
6. Display Completed Schedule The system displays the schedule containing the selected course offerings for the Student and the confirmation number for the schedule.

#### Some Alternate Flows of Events
1. Unidentified Student
In Step 1 of the Basic Flow, Logon, if the system determines that the student ID and/or password is not valid, an error message is
displayed

2. Quit
The Course Registration System allows the student to quit at any time during the use case. The Student may choose to save a partial
schedule before quitting. All courses that are not marked as "enrolled in" are marked as "selected" in the schedule. The schedule is saved in the system. The use case ends.
# Use Case Diagrams
A use case diagram at its simplest is a representation of a user's interaction with the system that shows the relationship between the user and the different use cases in which the user is involved. It is a `high level summary` of the actors and named used cases of a system

Use Case Diagrams use `UML`(Unified Modeling Language) to describe the functionality of a system as seen by the users in terms of:
* `actors` and their goals
* the system boundary: what is in scope and out of the scope of the system?
* the names of use cases for the system

### Actor
An external entities that interact with the system, that the actors `goals` must be `satisfied` by the system - such as `user role`, `another system`. 

# Scenario
Scenario is an instance of a use case, it contain a sequence of steps describing an interaction between a user and a system.

This diference between use case and Scenario is use case describes all possible `scenarios` involving in the functionality.
