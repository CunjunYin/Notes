# System Design
We need system design as it can:
1. Bridging the `gap` between desired and existing system in a manageable way
2. Model the new system to be developed as a set of subsystems

## decomposition
Any complex problem can be more easily handled if it is `subdivided into pieces` that can each be solved.

When system subdivided, single attribute can form a `modular`.

By showing decomposition modular diagramatically, provide useful for communication with stakeholders and for
project planning

## Information Hiding
Information hiding is the idea that every module should hide aspects of its implementation - exposing only an undestandable interface. 

Why:
1. leads to encapsulation
2. emphasizes communication through controlled interfaces
3. reduces the likelihood of `side effects`

## Indentifying subsystem
A first step in system design is to break down the solution domain into simpler parts - subsystem.

A `subsystem` is a collection of `classes`, `associations`, `operations`, `events` and `constraints` that are inter-related. 

Identifying subsystems usually involves backtracking, evaluation and revision of various solutions.

It is important to get the decomposition right as subsystems may implemented by different teams, thus bad decomposition can lead to unworkable designs.

Try grouping objects into subsystems by
* assigning objects in one use case into the same subsystem
* create a dedicated subsystem for objects used for moving data among subsystems
* minimizing the number of associations crossing subsystem boundaries
* ensure all objects in the same subsystem are functionally related

## Modular design
A design is modular when
* each activity of the system is performed by exactly one component
* inputs and outputs of each component are well-defined, in that every input and output is necessary for the function of that component
* the idea is to minimise the impact of later changes by abstracting from implementation details

# Coupling and cohesion
Cohesion measures the `dependence among classes`
* High cohesion: The `classes in the subsystem perform similar tasks` and are related to each other (via associations)
* Low cohesion: Lots of miscellaneous and auxiliary classes, no associations

Coupling measures `dependencies between subsystems`
* High coupling: Changes to one subsystem will have high impact on the other subsystem (change of model, massive recompilation, etc.)
* Low coupling: A change in one subsystem does not affect any other subsystem

Subsystems should have as maximum cohesion and minimum coupling as possible
