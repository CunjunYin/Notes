# Types of Requirements
Functional requirements: describe the functions that the
SW is to perform

    Example: The SW shall enable a student to enroll in a class

Non-functional requirements: requirements that constrain the solution

Examples of Non-functional Reqs
* Performance
* Maintainability
* Useability

## other Types of Non-functional Requirements
Product: a need or constraint on the software to be developed

Process: a requirement constraining the development of the SW

Emergent: requirements can not be addressed by a single component but depend on the interoperation of components

# Requirements classifications
`Requirement Priority`: the higher the priority the more essential the requirement is for meeting the overall goal of the SW. A fixed-point scale such as Must have, Should have, Could have, and Won’t have.

`Requirement Scope`: The extent to which a requirement affects the
SW and components. 

    Eg. Non-functional requirements such as response times have global scope

`Requirement Volatility`: Some requirements will change during the lifetime of the SW and even during development. It is useful to estimate the likelihood that a requirement will change so that developers can consider designs that are more tolerant of change.

# Viewpoints of Requirements
Interactor viewpoints: people or other systems that interact directly with the system

    e.g. ATM customer

Indirect viewpoints: stakeholders who do not use the system, but influence requirements

    e.g. bank management and security people


Domain viewpoints: constraints of the domain that influence requirements

    e.g. standards

# Requirements Negotiation

## Conflict / Negotiation
Conflicts occur when two stakeholders requirements are `mutually` `incompatible` with each other. Such as resources, deadline etc.

Software engineer should not make a `unilateral` `decision`, we should` consult with the stakeholder` to reach a consensus on an appropriate `tradeoff`.

> For `contractual` `reasons`, that such decisions be `traceable` `back` to the customer.

## Detecting Conflicts
### Order of Priority
One way to detecting conflicts is by order all requirements by `degree of importance`, as there may not be enough time or resources to implement all requirements. 

###MoSCoW
Another way to do it is by MoSCoW, MoSCoW stands for `Must` have, `Should` have, `Could` have, `Won’t` have. And ask ask the client to group their requirements of the system into two lists: 
* the DO list and 
* the NOT DO list.
  
MoSCoW rules have an advantage over the simple ranking method(eg 1-100) as for numerous requirements, this methods is much simpler by grouping them into two lists.


### Formal Methods
The final method is Formal Methods
* Construct a mathematical model of the requirements
* Use logical analysis to verify properties and identify inconsistencies
* Most methods have tool support and some have automatic analysis
* Popular models include 1st order logic, set theory (eg. Z), temporal logic, state machines

> all 3 methods have `weaknesses` in detecting conflicts as requirements are `not truly independent`, client might `not know` their priorities and stakeholders usually `do not` `agree with the priorities`.

# Resolving Conflicts
Resolving conflicts usually done by negotiation, as negotiation is introduced to facilitate requirements elicitation and analysis. Such as:
*  Encourages communication
*  Aids in understanding
*  Reveal conflict, solution exploration, collaborative resolution
*  Improves agreement level
*  Develop stakeholders’ satisfaction
*  Improves requirements quality

## Negotiation for `agile` software development
Agile is a methods to gather/prioritize/discovering requiremetns by collaborate with clients. 

Agile methods have to rely on contract where customer pays for time spent on system development rather than the time on developing a specific set of requirements.

> Negotiate on what to be delivered, i.e., the product
> 
> Software developer should be realistic on what they can deliver (i.e., do not over-promise just to get the contract signed)


## Boehm’s Win-Win Spiral
Multi-stakeholder involvement with coordination and collaboration based on
1. Win Conditions capture the desired objectives of the individuals
2. Conflict/Risk/Uncertainty specifications (CRU’s) capture the conflicts between win conditions and their associated risks and uncertainties.
3. Points of Agreement (POA’s) capture the agreed upon set of conditions which satisfy stakeholder win conditions and also define the system objectives.

### Win-Win Model
1. identify next-level stakeholders
2. identify their win conditions
3. reconcile win conditions
4. evaluate product and process alternatives; resolve
risks
5. define next level of product and process
6. validate next level of product and process
7. review & commitment; return to 1

# Feasibility studies
The feasibility studies is

INPUT
– set of preliminary business requirements
– an outline description of the system
– how the system is intended to support business processes
*  OUTPUT
– a report recommending whether or not it is worth carrying on with the
requirements engineering and system development process

# Requirements Evolution/Change
Requirements change during the process of software development, this may becasue:
1. User gains `better` `understanding` of the requirements
2. Changes to the `environment` of the organisation
3. Changes to `systems` or `processes` within an organisation
4. Development is a `discovery` process

T he consequences of requirements change are `Increased costs`, `Delays`, `Break “customer trust”`.

Severity of the consequences depends when in the life cycle the requirements change
* *Best case – review requirements specification
* Worst case – changes to requirements, design, implementation, tests and documentation

Therefore, when we gather requiremetns we should classfiy requirements into Two Classes:
* Enduring Requirements - Derive from an organisation’s core activity that relate directly to the problem domain, so `relatively` `stable`
* Volatile Requirements - Derive from the environment of the system, so likely to change.

Volatile Requirements can spilt into 4 catrgories
* Emergent - from improved understanding of the problem
* Consequential - as a result of using the delivered system
* Mutable - from changes to the environment of the organisation
* Compatibility - from changes to processes within the organisation
  
one way to track the requirment change is to make a `Traceability tables`

### Traceability tables
Like databases tables, each requirement havs a uniquely indentify number.
