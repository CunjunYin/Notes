# Prototyping - Show me
Prototypes for requirements validation demonstrate the requirements and help stakeholders discover problems.

The advantage of prototypes are:
* make it easier to interpret the software engineer’s assumptions
* allow client give useful feedback on why they are wrong

`Analysis prototypes` can be lightweight and need not contain software at all; they are for discovering what the users want.

`Validation prototypes` should be complete, reasonably efficient and robust. It should be possible to use them in the same way as the required system.

## Why Prototype? -
Requirement is is the need that the stakeholders want the system to satisfiy him, thus software requirements will persist and which will change. A way to help people to verbalize their software needs is by working `prototype`.

`Advantage`:
* make it easier to interpret the software engineer’s assumptions and, where needed, give useful feedback on why they are wrong. 


## Types of Prototype
* Software: create a new executable prototype
* Write a first draft of the user interface
* Modify existing SW to create a prototype for the new system
* Generate screen mock-ups with drawing software
* Draw mock-ups on white-boards or paper

# User manual development
Writing a user manual from the requirements forces a detailed requirements analysis and thus can reveal problems with the document

Information in the user manual:
* Description of the functionality and how it is implemented
* Which parts of the system have not been implemented
* How to get out of trouble
* How to install and get started with the system
