# Access Token
Access Token is a credential that allow client application access its user's protected resources behalf of the user. Access tokens in OAuth can take different forms such as `Randomly generated strings`, `JWTs`, or OAuth-specific token formats such as `Bearer Tokens`. Depends on implementation different information can be stored in access token, such as scopes, expiration datetime and client identity etc.

Access tokens are generally short-lived and can be revoked by the authorization server. Authorization server need to provide a way for resources server to validate access token.

## Requesting paramaters in `access code` exchange request
| Parameter     |      Description             |
|---------------|:-----------------------------|
| Audience      | The identifier is the intent of the resource the client is requesting access to. The authorization server include this identifier in the access token to ensure it only accepted by intended resource server - validate before further process.|
| Client ID     | The identifier is a value assigned to a client application when registering with the authorization server. It is used to identify the client application when it requests access to protected resources on behalf of an end user. |
| Client Secret |  Is a confidential string to authenticate client application with authorization server when requesting an access token. The secret was assigned by authorization server and should be kept private. |
| Code          | The identifier is the `Authorization Code` granted in Authorization Code issuing stage |
| Grant Type    | Can be `Authorization Code`, `Implicit`, `Resource Owner Password Credentials` and `Client Credentials`. [Refer to]()|
| Redirect Uri  | The APi location that the client application want the authorization server return the access code to, it must be pre-registered |

#### Grant Types
1. Authorization Code Grant: This grant type is used by confidential clients to obtain an access token after the user has granted permission for the client to access their protected resources. The client sends an authorization request to the authorization server, which returns an authorization code to the client. The client then exchanges the authorization code for an access token by sending a token request to the authorization server.

2. Implicit Grant: This grant type is used by public clients, such as web applications or mobile apps, to obtain an access token without exchanging an authorization code. The client sends an authorization request to the authorization server, which returns an access token directly to the client as part of the authorization response.

3. Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant: This grant type is used by confidential clients to obtain an access token by presenting the user's username and password directly to the authorization server. This grant type is not recommended, as it can compromise the security of the user's credentials.

4. Client Credentials Grant: This grant type is used by confidential clients to obtain an access token using their own credentials, rather than the user's credentials. This grant type is typically used for server-to-server communication, where the client application needs to access its own resources.


## Validation process before issue Access Token
1. Grant type check
```cs
AccessTokenFactory accessTokenFactory;
switch(model.grant_type){
    case "authorization_code":
        accessTokenFactory = new accessTokenFactory("authorization_code");
        break;
    case "implicit":
        ...
        ...
    default:
        // Bad Request: unsupported_grant_type
}
```
2. Client registration: The Client must be registered with the authorization server,the request must include client ID and secret key. This step helps ensure the client is legitimate.
```cs
var client = clients.getClientOrNull(model.client_id)
if (client == null)
{
    // Unknow client secret 
}

if(!model.client_secret.equals(client.client_secret)){
    // Illigal client secret
}
```
3. Authentication Code validation: The authorization server has cached the authentication code at the stage of issuing the authorization code. To validate the received authorization code just need to compare with cached authorization code. If exist, then do other necessary validation process depends on business security standards.
```cs
if(!model.validateAuthenticationCode()){
  // Authentication Code dosen't exist, or other validation failed. 
}

if (AuthenticationCodeCache.isUsed(model.code)) {
    // replay attack do necessary security process
}

// To prevent replay attack, Authentication Code can be only used once.
AuthenticationCodeCache.setUsed(code);
```
4. Generate access token: The OAuth2 standard doesn't specify any format, however, three principles must be followed: uniqueness, discontinuity, and unguessability. Common ways to generate token are share memory and [Introspection(rfc 7662)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7662).
* share memory example is shared database.
* Introspection example is JWTs

```cs
AccessTokenModel accessTokenModel = new AccessTokenModel();
accessTokenModel.client_id = client.client_id
accessTokenModel.scope = model.scope;
accessTokenModel.expires_in = DateTime.Now.ToString("MM-dd-yyyyThh:mm:ss");
accessTokenModel.access_token = generateAccessToken(accesstokenModel, "SECRET");
accessTokenModel.refresh_token = generateRefreshToken(accesstokenModel, "SECRET");
User user = getUser(model.code);

// For OpenID Extension, ID token also need to be included
accessTokenModel.id_token = generateIdToken(user, "SECRET");

return Ok({
    "access_token": accessTokenModel.client_id,
    "refresh_token": accessTokenModel.refresh_token,
    "expires_in": accessTokenModel.expires_in,
    "id_token": accessTokenModel.id_token,
    "token_type": "Bearer"
}, "application/json")
```

#### Example Token Generation
```cs
public string simpleAccessToken(string user){
  string accessToken = Guid.NewGuid().toString() + "|" DataTime.Now().add(300).toString();
  return accessToken;
}
```

## Short-lived access tokens


## Long-lived refresh tokens
