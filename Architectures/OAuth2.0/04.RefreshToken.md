# Access Token
In OAuth2.0 standard, the access token will expire because it's limited lifetime staandard. At the time after access token expired, if user still want the Client application to access the protected resources from resource server. Then the user need to go through the user authentication stage again. 

To improve user experence, instead of requiring the user to re-authenticate every time the access token expires, OAuth2.0 standard introduced the concept of refresh token, which the client application can use the refresh access token to obtain a new access token without any user interaction.

> Refresh token is issued along with access token, and each new access token will obtain a new refresh token - old refresh token will be rvoked out.

## Requesting paramaters in `refresh token` exchange request

Refer to [Access Token Exchange](./03.AccessToken.md), the process for issuing access token with refresh token is the same as issuing access token with authorization code, except the `grant_type` should be `refresh_token`.

## Validation process before issue Access Token

1. 
```cs
if(!"refresh_token".equals(model.grant_type)){
    // 
}
```

2. Refresh Token validation
```cs
if(!model.validateRefreshToken()){
  // Refresh Token dose not exist
}
```

3. Other Business Validate:
```cs
// Example this refresh token was assigned to this client
var client = clients.getClientOrNull(model.client_id)
if(!model.validateRefreshToken(client)) 
{
    // 403 Forbidden
}
```

4. Generate access token: Same as [Access Token Exchange](./03.AccessToken.md)
