In Fluent API design pattern methods calls are chained together by returns an object that has additional methods available, allowing the developer to chain those methods together. The advantage of this design is it can improve the usability and readability of the code by providing a more intuitive and expressive syntax.

```c#
public class FluentAPI {
    private string state = "";    
    public FluentAPI Method1(string value) {
        this.State += value;
        return this;
    }
    
    public Person Method2(int value) {
        this.State += value;
        return this;
    }
}

FluentAPI person = new FluentAPI()
    .Method1("Value")
    .Method2(30)
```
