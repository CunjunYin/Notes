# Factory Method

Provide an interface for creating objects, and let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. The Factory method lets a class defer instantiation it uses to subclasses by separate the process of creating objects from the client code that uses them.  This allows for greater flexibility in the creation of objects and promotes the use of polymorphism.

## Example
```c#
