# Abstract Factory
This particular design pattern is implemented for generating a sequence of interdependent objects without explicitly specifying their concrete classes.

Use Factory Abstract Factory pattern when
1. System must be independent on how objects are created, implemented.
2. System are configured with one of multiple families of products, with same interface.

## Example
In abstract factory pattern it's recommended is to explicitly declare interfaces for each distinct product of the product family
```c#
// Abstract Product
public interface Chair
{
    public int height();
}

public interface Desk
{
    public string color();
}
```

The Abstract Factory Class is an interface/abstract with a collection of creation methods for all products that are part of the product family.
```c#
// Abstract Factory
public abstract class FurnitureAbstractFactory
{
    public abstract Desk getDesk();
    public abstract Chair getChair();
}
```

Concrete implementation for Product
```c#
// Concrete Product
public class ModernDesk: Desk
{
    public override string color()
    {
        return "White";
    }
}


public class TraditionalDesk : Desk
{
    public string color()
    {
        return "brown";
    }
}

public class ModernChair: Chair
{
    public int height()
    {
        return 75;
    }
}

public class TraditionalChair: Chair
{
    public override int height()
    {
        return 55;
    }
}
```

For each product family varients, Abstract Factory need to implement a separate `Concrete Factory Class` extented from `Abstract Factory Class`
```c#
// Concrete Factory
public class ModernFurnitureFactory: FurnitureAbstractFactory
{
    public override Desk getDesk()
    {
        return new ModernDesk();
    }
    public override Chair getChair()
    {
        return new ModernChair();
    }
}

public class TraditionalFurnitureFactory : FurnitureAbstractFactory
{
    public override Desk getDesk()
    {
        return new TraditionalDesk();
    }
    public override Chair getChair()
    {
        return new TraditionalChair();
    }
}
```
## Advantages
|                     |      Description             |
|---------------------|:-----------------------------|
| Encapsulation       | Encapsulates the process of object creation, client donâ€™t need to concern about creation details|
| Flexibility         | Since it can switch factory class esaily, so it can be easily adapted to different environments, without requiring significant changes to the code   |
| Consistency         | Factory class is created in a standardized way |
| Modularity          | Each factory class is a collection of related product, this can improve the maintainability and scalability of the code(change one factory will not affecting the rest of the system) |

## Disadvantages
|                     |      Description             |
|---------------------|:-----------------------------|
| Complexity          | Encapsulate all possible product attributes that may be created. Increase the complexity of the abstract factory interface |
| Performance         | The creation of factory instance must go through the abstract factory interface |
