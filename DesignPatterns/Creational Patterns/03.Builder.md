# Builder
Builder design provides a flexible and reusable way to create complex objects. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

Use Factory Abstract Factory pattern when
* If an object have many properties to be initizlized, E.g. `Constructor with many paramaetes`. Then builder design pattern breaking it down into smaller steps.
* When you want to separate the construction and representation of an object, so different representations can be switched easily.

## Advantages
|                     |      Description             |
|---------------------|:-----------------------------|
| Scalability         | Since construction process is seperated, decoupled by not realying on classes |
| Flexibility | Can create different representations of an object using the same construction process |
| Error prevention | Objects are created indenpendtly, so in the building process each is properly initialized before they are used |


## Disadvantages
|                     |      Description             |
|---------------------|:-----------------------------|
| Performance | Step-by-step construction process can be slower and more resource-intensive than other methods of creating objects |
| Refracting | Product change will cause the builder implementation to change, some situation the cost is relatively high |
