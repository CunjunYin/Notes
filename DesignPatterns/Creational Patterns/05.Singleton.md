# Singleton
Singleton is a pattern that ensure a class can only has one instance, and provides a global point of access to the instance.

Use singleton design pattern is when
1. Only one instance of a class in the program
2. Global access point

## Example
```cs
public class SingletonDemo
{
    private static SingletonDemo instance;
    private List<string> data = new List<string>();
    private int index = 0;

    public SingletonDemo()
    {
        data.Add("1");
        data.Add("2");
        data.Add("3");
        data.Add("4");
        data.Add("5");
    }

    public static SingletonDemo GetInstance()
    {
        if (instance == null) {
            Console.WriteLine("Initialize Signleton");
            instance = new SingletonDemo();
        }

        return instance;
    }

    public string GetNextData()
    {
        var value = data[index];
        index = index + 1;
        if (index == data.Count)
        {
            index = 0;
        }
        return value;
    }
}
```

## Advantage of signletone
|                     |      Description             |
|---------------------|:-----------------------------|
| Resource sharing    | Signleton only has one instance, so resources can be shared with other instance. Which can better utlize resource and improve performance. |
| Global access       | Provides a global access point of its instance, easy to use and manage the instance from anywhere|
| Lazy initialization | Only need to initialize when the program need it |


## Disadvantage of signletone
|                     |      Description             |
|---------------------|:-----------------------------|
| Threading | In multithreaded environment, need to make sure in initializtion stage, threads wron't create singleton instance mutliple times |
| Difficult to test | Signleton can create dependencies that are hard to mock or stub, so it will be difficult to isolate and test specific parts of the program |
| Violates Single Responsibility Principle | The pattern solves two problems at the time. Provide functionality and ensure only one instance can be created. |
| Memory Caching | Signleton will store it's instance in memory even it's not required after initialization |

## `Singleton` vs `Static`
A singleton allows access to a single created instance - that instance (or rather, a reference to that instance) can be passed as a parameter to other methods, and treated as a normal object.

A static class allows only static methods.
