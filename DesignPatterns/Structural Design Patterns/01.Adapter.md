# Adapter
Allows classes with incompatible interfaces to collaborate together by provide a middleware to convert a class's interface to another interface desired contract.

Use adapter design pattern when
* When you want another product to work with your current one, but refactoring is expensive.
* Existing class whose methods does not match the requirements

## Example
```c#
public interface ITarget
{
    public void Targetrequest();
}

public class ConcreteTarget : ITarget
{
    public void Targetrequest()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Target method");
    }
}

public class Adaptee
{
    public void AdapteeRequest()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Adaptee method");
    }
}

public class Adapter : ITarget
{
    private readonly Adaptee _adaptee;

    public Adapter(Adaptee adaptee)
    {
        _adaptee = adaptee;
    }

    public void Targetrequest()
    {
        _adaptee.AdapteeRequest();
    }
}

public class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var adaptee = new Adaptee();
        var target = new Adapter(adaptee);
        target.Targetrequest();
    }
}
```

## Advantages
|                     |      Description             |
|---------------------|:-----------------------------|
| Reusability | No need to modify to existing code |
| Interoperability | Different frameworks/languages to work together |
| Encapsulation | The client code doesn't need to know the details of how the adapter works. |


## Disadvantages
|                     |      Description             |
|---------------------|:-----------------------------|
| Complexity          | Increase complexity due to additional layer of abstraction |
| Maintenance         | Decrease maintability due to another functionality requries tests  |
| Performance         | Decrease performance due to transformation procedures |
