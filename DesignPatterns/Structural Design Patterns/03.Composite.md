# Composite
The Composite Design Pattern compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.

The pattern defines a hierarchy of objects, where each object can either be a leaf or a composite. A leaf object represents a single element, while a composite object represents a group of elements. Composite objects can contain one or more leaf objects, as well as other composite objects.

The key idea behind the Composite pattern is that the client code doesn't need to know whether it's dealing with a single object or a group of objects. This makes the code more flexible, as it can work with both individual objects and composite objects without having to change the code.

## Example
1. This is the abstract base class that defines the interface for both leaf and composite objects.
```c#
public abstract class Component
{
    protected string name;
    protected bool IsLeaf = false;

    public Component(string name)
    {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public abstract string Operation();

    public virtual void Add(Component component)
    {
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }

    public virtual void Remove(Component component)
    {
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }
}
```

2. This is the concrete class that represents a group of elements in the tree structure. It contains a collection of child components, which can be either leaf or composite objects.
```c#
public class Composite : Component
{
    protected List<Component> Children = new List<Component>();

    public Composite(string name) : base(name)
    {
    }

    public override void Add(Component component)
    {
        Children.Add(component);
    }

    public override void Remove(Component component)
    {
        Children.Remove(component);
    }

    public override string Operation()
    {
        return $"Composite: {name}";
    }
}
```
3. This is the concrete class that represents a single element in the tree structure.
```c#
public class Leaf : Component
{
    public Leaf(string name) : base(name)
    {
        IsLeaf = true;
    }

    public override string Operation()
    {
        return $"Leaf: {name}";
    }
}
```

```c#
public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var root = new Composite("Root");
        root.Add(new Leaf("Leaf A"));
        root.Add(new Leaf("Leaf B"));

        var composite = new Composite("composite");
        root.Add(new Leaf("Composite Leaf A"));
        root.Add(new Leaf("Composite Leaf B"));

        root.Add(composite);
    }
}
```
