# Strategy
Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that turns a set of behaviors into objects and makes them interchangeable inside original context object.

Interface is used to define public interface common to all concrete strategies. Context class use same interface for all strategies.
```c#
public interface IStrategy
{
    public void Algorithm();
}
```

Context class maintains a reference to one of the concrete strategy, and call concrete strategy by common public interface.
```c#
public class Context
{
    private IStrategy strategy { get; set; }

    public Context()
    { }

    public Context(IStrategy strategy)
    {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }

    public void SetStrategy(IStrategy strategy)
    {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }

    public void ExecuteStrategy()
    {
        this.strategy.Algorithm();
    }
}
```

Concrete Strategy implementation
```c#
public class ConcreteStrategyA : IStrategy
{
    public void Algorithm()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("ConcreteStrategyA Algorithm");
    }
}

public class ConcreteStrategyB : IStrategy
{
    public void Algorithm()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("ConcreteStrategyB Algorithm");
    }
}
```

In strategy design pattern, client decide which concrete strategy to use and set the reference for the `Context`.
```c#
public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var context = new Context();
        Console.WriteLine("Client: Strategy is set to normal sorting.");
        context.SetStrategy(new ConcreteStrategyA());
        context.ExecuteStrategy();

        Console.WriteLine();

        Console.WriteLine("Client: Strategy is set to reverse sorting.");
        context.SetStrategy(new ConcreteStrategyB());
        context.ExecuteStrategy();
    }
}
```
