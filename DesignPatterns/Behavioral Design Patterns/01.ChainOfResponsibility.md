# Chain Of Responsibility
Chain Of Responsibility is linking objects into a chain, so upon a request, each object decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next object in the chain.

Use observer design pattern when
* Request need to go through a particular order
* Request exact type is unknow beforehand, but the program need to process differently depends on the request type.
* 

## Example

Handler abstract class is need to define a set of methods that common to all `Concrete Handlers`, common boilerplate methods can be eliminated in Concrete implementation. In generaly it contain a a method for building the chain of handlers and a method for executing a request.   
```c#
abstract class AbstractHandler
{
    protected AbstractHandler successor;

    public AbstractHandler SetSuccessor(AbstractHandler handler)
    {
        this.successor = handler;

        // Below return will make the chain creation easiler
        return this.successor;
    }

    public abstract void Handle(object request);
}
```

Each Concrete Handler class has it's own `Handle` implemetaion, in the Handle implementation it should contain two functionoalities:
1. Whether it’ll process the request.
2. Whether it’ll pass the request along the chain.
```c#
class ConcreteHandlerA : AbstractHandler
{
    public override void Handle(object request)
    {
        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty((request as string)))
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Empty request");
        }
        else if (this.successor != null)
        {
            this.successor.Handle(request);
        }
    }
}

class ConcreteHandlerB : AbstractHandler
{
    public override void Handle(object request)
    {
        if ((request as string).Equals("Active"))
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Request state equals Active");
        }
        else if (this.successor != null)
        {
            this.successor.Handle(request);
        }
    }
}

class ConcreteHandlerC : AbstractHandler
{
    public override void Handle(object request)
    {
        if ((request as string).Equals("Pause"))
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Request state equals Pause");
        }
        else if (this.successor != null)
        {
            this.successor.Handle(request);
        }
    }
}
```

Either client code assemble the `chain` or delegate it to factory classes.
```c#
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // The other part of the client code constructs the actual chain.
        var chain = new ConcreteHandlerA();
        chain.SetSuccessor(new ConcreteHandlerB()).SetSuccessor(new ConcreteHandlerC());

        var requests = new List<string>{ "", "Pause", "BadRequest", "Active" };

        foreach (var request in requests)
        {
            chain.Handle(request);
        }
    }
}
```
