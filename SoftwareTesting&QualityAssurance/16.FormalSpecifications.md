# Formal specifications
Formal specifications have a meaning defined in terms of mathematics.

Formal specifications `can potentially` help reveal ambiguity, vagueness, contradiction and some gaps in completeness.

But detecting whether a specification is complete is more difficult, as there are nearly always some details that are left undefined, or scenarios that may not have been considered.

# Alloy specification language - Alloy
Alloy’s are defined in terms of mathematical relations.

Such as `is less than` is amn relation

### `sigs`
```java
// There are things called animals
sig Animal {}

// A cat is a sort of animal
sig Cat extends Animal {}
```

### `subtypes`
`extends` indicates subtypes
```Java
sig FSObject {}
sig Dir extends FSObject {}
sig File extends FSObject {}

// Here, Dir and File are both subtypes of FSObject, so Dir and File are considered to be mutually disjoint sets.
```

### `properties`
```Java
// There are such things as FSObjects. An FSObject has the property ‘parent’. An FSObject can have zero or one parents.
sig FSObject { parent: lone Dir }

// A directory in the file system
sig Dir extends FSObject { contents: set FSObject }

// A file in the file system
sig File extends FSObject { }
```

```
lone: zero or one
some: one or more
one:  exactly one
set:  zero or more
```

### `facts`
```Java
// All file system objects are either files or directories
fact { File + Dir = FSObject }
```

The general syntax for a fact is 
```Java
fact name { formulas }
```
formulas are Boolean expressions, and by putting them in a fact, we’re constraining them to be true.

### `abstract signatures`
An alternative way to say that all `FSObjects` must be `Dirs` or `Files` would be to declare FSObject abstract. Means there are no objects that are directly of type FSObject, they must be members of some subtype, instead.

### `operators`
Operators are available to construct Boolean expressions.
`subset: in`
* set1 in set2 — set1 is a subset of set2

`set equality: =`
* set1 = set2 — set1 equals set2

`scalar equality: =`
* scalar = value — scalar equals value

`and`, `or` `implies`, `iff`, `not`

### `Relations`
```Java
sig Something {
  // Things of type Something have a field1, which is FieldType 
  field1 : FieldType,
  // Things of type Something have field1a & field2a, which is OtherFieldType 
  field2a, field2b : OtherFieldType
}
```
