# Test structure
Tests consisting of two things
* Test values: anything required to set up the system and compute it and observe the result.
* Expected values: what the system is expected to do.

`Values` can mean anything that the `function` need. Such as powered on/off the phone, click.

## Example - unit test
Unit test, test testing one method of a class. so `Values` are:
1. whatever actions/inputs we need to make the methods to run, then execute the method and store the result

And our `expected values` are:
* what we expect the method to return or do.
```Java
public class CalculatorTest {
    @Test
    public void evaluatesExpression() {
        Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
        int sum = calculator.evaluate("1+2+3");
        assertEquals(6, sum);
    }
}

/**
"1+2+3" are input values
int sum, used to store values
6 is expected values
**/
```

# Test structure - arrange, act, assert
Another way of thinking about what tests consist of is to use what’s called the `Arrange, Act, Assert` model.
* Arrange means whatever setup is needed
* Act means the way we invoke some behaviour of the test subject
* Assert describes how we verify that the behaviour had the desired effect – for instance, by evaluating a return value, or observing a side-effect
