# Risk
Risk is something that might happen, which would cause loss
* If it will definitely happen, that’s not a risk – it’s usually called a `constraint`
* If it doesn’t result in some kind of unwanted consequence- it’s also not a risk

## What are some sorts of risk?
* Project risks - Things that could affect the project plan or schedule
  * Examples:: personnel move or resign, resources turn out to be more expensive/take longer to acquire than estimated, exchange rates shift
* Technical risks - Risks resulting from the problem being harder to solve than we thought, if happens, implementation may become difficult or impossible
  * Example: design turns out to be infeasible, dependencies have bugs
* Business risks - Things that threaten the viability, as a product, of the software to be built
  * Example: over-estimating the market for a product; being beaten to release by a competitor

* Known risks - Risk can be found by research the project deeply.
* Predictable risks - Those risks that are extrapolated from past project experience
* Unpredictable risks - Those risks that can and do occur, but are extremely difficult to identify in advance

## Risk strategies
* Reactive risk strategies - Nothing is done about risks until something goes wrong
* Proactive risk strategies - have a contingency plan in place to handle unavoidable risks in a controlled and effective manner

## Steps for risk management
1. Identify possible risks; recognize what can go wrong
2. Analyze each risk to estimate the probability that it will occur and the impact that it will do if it does occur
3. Rank the risks by probability and impact
   * Impact may be negligible, marginal, critical, and catastrophic
4. Develop a plan to manage (some of) those risks

## Risk identification
systematic attempt to identify risks to the project, ther are two main sorts of risk:
* Generic risks
  * Risks that are common to every software project
* Product-specific risks
  * Risks that can be identified only by those a with a clear understanding of the technology, the people, and environment specific to the software that is to be built

One way of identifying risks – use a `risk checklist`

## Risk estimation
Risk estimation attempts to rate each risk, by `probability that it happen`s and `magnitude of loss associated with the risk`.

We do this as not all risk is important, so risks can be prioritized, and limited resources be allocate to most impact risk.

### Risk tables
A risk table provides a project manager with a simple technique for risk projection

It consists of five columns
* Risk summary – short description of the risk
* Risk category – (see above)
* Probability – estimation of risk occurrence based on group input
* Categorization of impact – e.g. (1) catastrophic (2) critical (3) marginal (4) negligible
* RMMM – pointer to a paragraph in the Risk Mitigation, Monitoring, and Management Plan

#### Risk likelihood
Probability is hard to get in this case

Typically, we will divide “likelihood” into about 3 or 5 categories.

> unlikely; medium likelihood; highly likely

#### Risk impact
As with likelihoods, impact is usually divided into 3 or 5 categories – for instance:
> low impact, medium impact, high impact.
