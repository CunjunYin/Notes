# Software reviews
A catch all term for filters that can be applied at various points during the software development process

## Code Inspections
Inspections are a formal, efficient and economical method of finding faults in design and code

## Code Walk-throughs
A Code Walk-through is an informal meeting where the programmer leads the review team through his/her code and the reviewers try to identify faults

You can do this with your own code but it is more effective if the reviewer is not the same person as the programmer
## Fagan Inspections
Amore formal version of a code walk-through

Procedure:
1. Overview
2. Preparation
3. Inspection
4. Rework
5. Follow up

## Semantic Analysis of Code
Analysis based on a model of the meaning (i.e. semantics) of a program
* Formal Proofs: prove a given program (model) satisfies a required property
* Control Flow Analysis: analysis of the directed graph of the control structure of a program to identify inaccessible code, infinite loops and poor structure
* Data Flow Analysis: analysis of a diagrammatic representation of the flow of data throughout a program
* Symbolic Execution: check for agreement between code and specification using algebraic vars in place of input data.

Assignment statements produce algebraic output which can be compared with expected results.

## Analysis of Code Metrics
Measures of properties of code which may predict how likely the code is to contain errors

# Quality assurance

## What is Quality Management | software quality assurance (SQA)
Quality management is an overall activity that covers the entire software process. Such as develop a correct software  rather than repeated software development again. So reduce the amount of rework, thereby reducing costs and shorten developing time. 

### SQA invloves
* A software quality assurance process
* Specific quality assurance and quality control tasks
* Effective software engineering practices
* Control of all software work products and the changes made to them
* A procedure to ensure compliance with software development standards
* Measurement and reporting mechanisms

## Software Quality definition
```
Conformance to explicitly stated functional and performance requirements, explicitly documented development standards, and implicit characteristics that are expected of all professionally developed software”
```

This definition emphasizes three points
* Software requirements are the foundation from which quality is measured; lack of conformance to requirements is lack of quality
* Specified standards define a set of development criteria that guide the manner in which software is engineered; if the criteria are not followed, lack of quality will almost surely result
* A set of implicit requirements often goes unmentioned; if software fails to meet implicit requirements, software quality is suspect

Other 

Quality of design (quality intend to offer)
* The characteristic that designers specify for an item
* This encompasses requirements, specifications, and the design of the system
  
Quality of conformance (implementation)
* The degree to which the design specifications are followed during manufacturing
* This focuses on how well the implementation follows the design and how well the resulting system meets its requirements

# Quality Control
Quality Control involves a series of inspections, reviews, and tests used throughout the software process, that ensures that each work product meets the requirements placed on it. Includes:
1. Requires all work products to have defined, measurable specification
2. Combines measurement and feedback in order to adjust the process when product specifications are not met
3. a feedback loop to the process that created the work product

## The Cost of Quality
Cost of quality includes all costs incurred in the pursuit of quality or in performing quality-related activities.

Cost of Quality aim for:
1. Provide a baseline for the current cost of quality
2. Identify opportunities for reducing the cost of quality
3. Provide a normalized basis of comparison

Cost of quality increases dramatically as the activities progress from
> Prevention > Detection  > Internal failure > External failure

### Kinds of Quality Costs
Prevention costs - ensure mistakes never creep in
* Process invloved - Quality planning, formal technical reviews, test equipment, training

Appraisal costs - check whether have mistakes
* Process invloved - Inspections, equipment calibration and maintenance, testing

Failure costs
* Internal failure costs
  * occurred when an error is detected in a product prior to shipment - Include rework, repair, and failure mode analysis
* External failure costs
  * Involves defects found after the product has been shipped - Include complaint resolution, product return and replacement etc

# SQA Activities
* Prepares an SQA plan for a project
* Participates in the development of the project’s software process description
* Reviews software engineering activities to verify compliance with the defined software process
* Audits designated software work products to verify compliance with those defined as part of the software process
* Ensures that deviations in software work and work products are documented and handled according to a documented procedure
* Records any noncompliance and reports to senior management
* Coordinates the control and management of change
* Helps to collect and analyze software metrics
