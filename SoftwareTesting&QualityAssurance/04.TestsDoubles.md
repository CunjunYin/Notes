# Test Doubles
Test doubles replace software components that cannot be used during testing, it is a software component that implements partial
functionality to be used during testing

The reasons for test doubles
* Component has not been written
* The real component does something destructive that we want to avoid during testing (unrecoverable actions)
* The real component interacts with an unreliable resource
* The real component runs very slowly
* The real component creates a test cycle
  * A depends on B, B depends on C, C depends on A

Test Double can classified into following categories:
- Dummy objects
- Fake objects
- Stubs
- Spies
- Mocks

### `Dummy objects`
These are objects that are passed around but not used – for instance, they may be used to fill parameter lists

Examples are some languages with a null, Nil or undefined value, we might be able to use that value as Dummy objects

### `Fake objects`
Fake objects actually do have working implementations, but for some reason are not suitable for production

An example of this is when we use an in-memory database, instead of an on-disk database

### `Stubs`
Stubs provide canned answers to calls made during the test

For example, the answers are usually fixed, and don’t change in response to the parameters passed

### `Spies`
These are stubs that record information on how they were called.

These are particularly useful for testing code that calls.  (e.g.) an object representing a server, such as a mail server, or which writes to a file-like object.

For example, In Java, we often write to files using classes like BufferedWriter, to verify the data we could use a `Spy` class that implements the java.io.Writer class – but instead of writing to a file, it records whatever data would have been written.

### `Mocks`
Mock object is pre-programmed to expect particular calls, and respond with a particular behaviour.

Unlike the other types of test double, mock objects can verify things about the behaviour of a class.
