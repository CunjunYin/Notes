# Formal methods
Formal methods are system design techniques that use `rigorously specified mathematical models` to build software and hardware systems. So it can prove a model's correcness mathematically.

>  Tests can only show the situations where a system won't fail, but cannot say anything about the behavior of the system `outside of the testing scenarios`. Basically means we don’t find bugs in tests, but not mean that bugs doesn’t exist, the bugs may in `outside of the testing scenarios`.

> note: formal verification does not obviate the need for testing

### Formal methods following three step process
1. Specification - Some functionality that `system` need
2. Modeling - How we present the system, i.e. actual code, abstract model, state machine
3. Verification - Prove the model meet the specification

## Program verification
Prove that if the starting state of a program satisfies particular properties, then the end state after
executing a program satisfies some other properties.

There are two properties:
* preconditions - assertions that hold after execution
* postconditions - assertions that hold prior to execution of a piece of code

### example
``` python
n := 0
while j > 0:
    n := n + i
    j := j - 1
return n

# input variables are i and j, our precondition might be
## i and j are any integers

# output variable is n
## n equals (the original value of) i times (the original value of) j
```

## Assertions
Assertions are predicates that hold of variables, such as true or false, given variables as input.

Example
```Python
# Bounds on elements of the data
n >= 0

# Ordering properties of the data
for all j : 0 <= j < n − 1 : aj <= aj+1

{ pre : T } # no precondiction -- "top" or "true"
i := a
j := b
n := 0
while j > 0: # Assertions
    n = n + i
    j = j - 1

{ post: n = a * b } # Assertions
```

## Invariants
invariant is a property of a mathematical object which remains unchanged after operations or transformations of a certain type are applied to the objects

```Python
# square root example algorithm
a := 0
b := n + 1
{ pre : n  0 }
{ inv P: a < b <= n+1 and a^2 <= n < b^2 } # invariant
while a + 1 != b:
    d := (a + b) div 2
    if d * d <= n:
        a := d
    else:
        b := d
{ post: a^2 <=> n < (a + 1)2 }
```

## Termination
In a loop, sometime it dosent terminate, such as
```python
while True:
    #TODO
```
There are two ways of prove program like this
1. partial correctness - doesn’t require a program to terminate
2. total correctness - does require a program to terminate

### Partial correctness
if we have a triple {Φ} P {Ψ}, then we say that it is `satisfied under partial correctness` if
1. all states which satisfy the preconditions - Φ
2. state resulting from executing P satisfies the postcondition - Ψ
3. if P actually terminates

Basically if program actually terminates then preconditions and postcondition are all true

#### Example
```python
# partial correctness is satisfied program dosent end.
{ pre : T } # no precondiction -- "top" or "true"
i := a
j := b
n := 0
while true:
    pass
{ post: n = a * b }
```

#### Why we use Partial correctness?
Well, often it’s handy to tackle a proof of correctness in two stages:
1. Prove that if the program terminates, then it produces the results we want
2. Prove that the program terminates

### Total correctness
if we have a triple {Φ} P {Ψ}, then we say that it is `satisfied under total correctness` if
1. all states which satisfy the preconditions - Φ
2. state resulting from executing P satisfies the postcondition - Ψ and P is guaranteed to terminate

## rules:
`Composition`
```
If we have {a} P1 {b} and {b} P2 {c}
then we can derive {a} P1 ; P2 {c}
```

`assignment`
The assignment rule states that, after an assignment, any predicate that was previously true for the right-hand side of the assignment now holds for the variable on the left-hand side.

```
A[E/x] x:= E{A}
```
* A represents some assertion about variables;
* A[E/x] means, “A, but wherever x appears, substitute for it the expression E instead”

`Conditional`
```
{ a ∧ C } P1 { b }, and we have { a ∧ ¬C } P2 { b }
{ a } if C then P1 else P2 { b }
```

## While
### Partial while
The rule for partial correctness of while loops is:

If we have a triple `{ A ^ B } P { A }`

then we can derive: `{ A } while B do P done { ¬B ^ A }`

This works as `A` is a loop invariant(Not change), if we got out of the loop `B` change to  `¬B`.

### Total while
If we can prove partial correctness for a while loop;

and we can prove the loop terminates;

then we’ve proved total correctness - By `Hoare logic`

[ preconditions, code fragment, postconditions ], we call this a Hoare triple

#### Example
``` python
{ pre : b >= 0 } # precondiction
i := a
j := b
n := 0
{ j > 0 and L } # partial while
while j > 0:
    n = n + i
    j = j - 1
{ j <= 0 and L } # partial while
{ post: n = a * b } # postcondiction

# Let L be :  (j*i) + n = a*b 
# L is an invariant, founded
```
