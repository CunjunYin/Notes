# Program specification

## Problems in specifying systems
`Ambiguities`. Statements which can be interpreted in multiple different ways.

`Contradictions`. In a very large set of specifications, it can be difficult to tell whether there are requirements that contradict each other. 

`Vagueness`. Vagueness occurs when it’s unclear what a concept covers, or which things belong to a category and which don’t.

    `is tall` is vague: some people are definitely tall, and some are definitely short, but it can be difficult to tell when exactly someone meets the criterion of being tall.

`Incompleteness`. This covers specifications that, for instance, fail to specify what should happen in some case.

    A user may specify normal or emergency mode when requesting a system shutdown. In normal mode, pending operations shall be logged and the system shut down within 2 minutes.

    In this case it didnt specify what happens in emergency mode.

In addition to these, there are many other ways requirements can be written poorly-
* Overly long and complex sentences
* undefined jargon terms
* don’t satisfy business needs
